Document 4: Complete evasion, Zero modifications: PF attacks on I txt detection.

The main focus of tihs study was creating a software known as "PDFuzz", which created entropy in PDFs without actually changing any of the content. 
The model only modifies the text formatting and doesn't change any of the textual content, and says that they ned more reobust evaluation methodologies.
Points out how easy it is to evade detectors without impacting visual presetation.

Document 5: paraphrasing evades detectors of AI-generated text, retrieval is an effective defense.

Analyzes the ability of ai detectors to find paraphrased text. Created a paraphrasing model that paraphrases paragraphs, and what they found was that
detection accuracy drops significantly. 

Document 6: Generative AI detection in higher education assessments

The rapid adoptment of generative AI requires a review of academic integiryt mechanisms. 
Says that
